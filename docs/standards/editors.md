# Editors

Choose the editing presentation by attention, space, and navigation needs, and never lose a draft silently.

## Rules

| Task | Presentation |
| --- | --- |
| Sustained, multi-section work or navigation among related details | Pushed/fullscreen editor |
| Focused self-contained edit with useful underlying context | Native bottom/form sheet |
| Small contextual capture or adjustment | Keyboard-anchored popup/composer |

- A popup augments the current task; expanding it to a fuller editor preserves the same draft. A small field count alone does not justify an overlay when validation or nested navigation needs more space. Web uses its corresponding accessible page/dialog/popover controls; platform styling is not part of the contract.
- Saved data changes only on commit. Scope a draft to its account and item/context. A clean editor dismisses immediately; a dirty editor preserves its draft or asks before losing meaningful changes. Explicit Discard abandons it. Apply the same policy to close, Back, swipe dismissal, and presentation changes.
- Save reflects clean, changed, invalid/conflicting, pending, and failed states. Block duplicate commits; failure preserves the draft and offers recovery. Choose screen-level native toolbar actions for full editors and sheets; keep a composer's submit action beside its input. Give icon actions accessible names.
- View and edit are separate tasks: viewing reads saved data; editing owns a draft, validation, and save. Create the draft once per editing session and keep it when switching presentation; calling the same hook twice does not share state.
- Page and sheet are presentations, not separate screens. When content and behavior match, reuse one screen and set the presentation in the navigator. Add page/sheet wrappers only when composition differs; they share content or form components and own navigation and dismissal.
- Use routed sheets for navigable tasks and local sheets for auxiliary controls.
- One owner coordinates scroll, keyboard, safe-area insets, and dismissal. The focused input and required actions stay visible. Avoid layering platform hosts inside keyboard windows unless the installed runtime supports that composition.

## Implementation

The developer-tools mobile lab demonstrates native inputs. Workouts' Diary Entry and goals editors are product bindings with dated evidence. Workouts' InputAccessoryView/SwiftUI crash workaround is runtime-specific, not a ban on keyboard-anchored editors.

## Verify

- Open/focus, next field, nested popup, expansion, dismissal by each route, reopen, invalid input, failed commit, large text, and keyboard motion.
- Closed auxiliary controls leave the parent tappable.

## Exceptions

Record in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`: rule, scope, replacement, reason. Runtime-specific workarounds belong beside the affected adapter.
